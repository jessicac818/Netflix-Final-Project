# Netflix-Bootcamp-Final-Project

##### Team Members: Samantha, Thomas, Jessica

### About Project: 
For our final project, we analyzed the relationship between manga and anime. Anime is a film/television animation. Manga a style of comic book/novel. Usually a manga is written and then produced into an anime. What we are interested in discovering is the depth of the relationship between a manga an anime. 

### Questions we are interested in answering include:

1. How are Manga genres different from one another when compared to the Anime ratings?
   
2. Which animes will get renewed/discontinued based off of genre and the popularity trends of the manga series?

3. Does the length of the manga determine its succcess (ratings?) (how long is their anime?)?
