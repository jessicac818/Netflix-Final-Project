# Netflix-Bootcamp-Final-Project

### Team Members: Samantha, Thomas, Jessica

### About Project: 
For our final project, we analyzed the relationship between manga and anime. Anime is a film/television animation. Manga a style of comic book/novel. Usually a manga is written and then produced into an anime. What we are interested in discovering is the depth of the relationship between a manga and it's corresponding anime. 


### Questions we are interested in answering include:

1. How are Manga genres different from one another when compared to the Anime ratings?
   
2. Which animes will get renewed/discontinued based off of genre and the popularity trends of the manga series?

3. Does the length of the manga determine its succcess (ratings?) (how long is their anime?)?

### The Process
We analyzed two data sets from 2015, one with data from animes and one with manga information. We cleaned the Japanese novel datasets to only include information for strictly mangas (there were a variety of novel types within our dataset like one-shot, which are short stories). We only analyzed anime series that had a corresponding manga series and manga series that had an anime series which existed or was in the works.
